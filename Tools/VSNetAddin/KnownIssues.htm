        <P align="left"><FONT face="Tahoma" size="2">The following issues were known 
                at&nbsp;the time of this release.</FONT></P>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">The first time you install the Addin, the Script 
                    Explorer window is not docked with the IDE.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">If you open a Visual Studio.NET project with an NAnt 
                    script that is read only (either by file system attributes, or because the 
                    script is checked in to a Visual Sourcesafe Project), the node for that project 
                    in the Addin will have some of its features (correctly) disabled. To re-enable 
                    full access to the script after removing the read-only attribute you must click 
                    the project node and press the "refresh" button on the Addin.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <FONT face="Verdana" size="2"></FONT>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">The "code" attribute of the NAnt "script" task needs 
                    to launch a window to allow you to edit the script in a larger text box dialog. 
                    I couldn't get UITypeEditors to work from my Addin so currently this is just a 
                    string field.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <FONT face="Verdana" size="2"></FONT>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">The bitmap image used for the tab on the ToolWindow 
                    when docked with the IDE has a lime green background. Microsoft documentation 
                    says the background color of this image should be RGB(0, 255, 0) in the help. 
                    Newsgroups say RGB(0, 254, 0) is the correct color. Neither of these approaches 
                    currently work (they do work for context menus and toolbar buttons though).</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">The context menu displayed when right-clicking on 
                    TreeNodes does not update the Visual Studio.NET properties window with the 
                    correct properties until the context menu is closed (or clicked). This is not a 
                    functional issue since as soon as you select a command or click another node 
                    the correct properties show up.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Renaming a property or target works, but to get the 
                    text to accept after typing the new name you must select another node. This 
                    should accept the text when you type the Enter key, but currently does not (and 
                    needs to be looked into).</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">If you open a project with one NAnt script, add a new 
                    or existing file that is another NAnt script, and close the project without 
                    saving changes, the node for the second script still shows up in the Addin. 
                    Disabling and re-enabling the Addin will reset to the correct number of nodes.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Building an NAnt project with the "NDoc" task only 
                    works with the version of the NDoc runtime .dll included with this Addin. There 
                    is a bug in NDoc that is currently still being accepted into the main branch 
                    that fixes this.</FONT></LI></UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Building an NAnt project which launches other 
                    command-line processes (like csc.exe) shows the other process in a separate 
                    command-line window. It would be nice to get these to redirect their output to 
                    the build window and stay hidden.</FONT></LI></UL>
